  * Grill
  * Fryer
  * Assembly station

Technical Experience / Side Projects
--------------------

### *EngiNERDs Robotics team: 2020-2025*
* Learn engineering concepts and CAD design
   * everything is put into CAD, requiring work efficiency
   * because everything will be put on the robot, we have to cad for manufacturing and assembly
* Work with others to build complex designs in 6 weeks
  * section-based design and specialized student work.
* Competing over multiple days requiring on-site maintenance and development to win matches
* Strategic competition requiring different robotics teams to work together to complete goals

### *Impulze3d - Custom Crossed Gantry FDM 3d-Printer*
* Large format FDM 3d-printer
  * **310x310x350mm** build volume
  * Triple Belted Z axis motors for smooth and fast bed control
    * Capable of **true bed leveling** using 3 points of contact and maxwell kinematic mounts
    * **200mm/s bed movement** with 3 endstops to rough-home the printer to be used with [beacon probe](https://beacon3d.com/). This ensures the bed is level enough for any probe to work without high Z travel movements
* Crossed gantry design
   * 4 motors for X and Y movement, not just 2 like typical CoreXY designs
   * faster accelerations at quality, up to **40,000mm/s^2 (4Gs) acceleration**, regularly print at **20k accel**
   * Shorter belt paths for better positional accuracy and less "ringing"

### *Solid State Filament Spool Dryer / Solid State Dehumidifier*
* Solid state, low maintenance cost dehumidifier
  * No more silica gel
  * Consums only power without interchanging parts (like silica gel)
* High temp goal of 100c or greater
  * Able to dry tougher plastics like PC or Nylon
* Long-term dehumidifier, setup and forget it
  * The goal is to evaporate the water outside of the dehumidifier, moving water from the storage box to the outside


### Programming Experience
*   **JavaScript:** Personal script projects (my largest being a multi-use discord bot), mostly know NodeJS when it comes to JavaScript

*   **TypeScript:** Exposure from Javascript, much similar and both have their own uses, typescript was learned as an alternative to block code in a computer science class

*   **Python:** Still learning...
