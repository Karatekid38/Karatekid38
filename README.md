Technical Experience
--------------------

#### My Cool Side Project
Impulze3d
* Large format 3d-printer
  * 310x310x350mm build volume
  * Triple Belted Z axis motors for smooth and fast bed control
    * Capable of true bed leveling using 3 points of contact and a maxwell kinematic mount
    * 200mm/s bed movement with 3 endstops to rough-home the printer to be used with beacon probe. This ensures the bed is level enough for any probe to work without high Z travel movements
  * Crossed gantry design
    * 4 motors for X and Y movement, not just 2 like typical CoreXY designs
    * faster accelerations at quality, up to 40,000mm/s^2 (4Gs) acceleration
    * Shoter belt paths for better positional accuracy and less "ringing"
* Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
